# Pymaceuticals

A new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications recently began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

 In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.


## Pymaceuticals Inc. - Analysis
The study's numbers and counts show that Capomulin and Ramicane drugs are close in number, with 230 and 228 counts each, suggesting they're competitors.
Male mice count 958 and females 922, indicating 51% males and 49% females in the study. Capomulin was tested on 102 males and 128 females.
Among the top four drugs, only Infubinol has an unusual result. Ceftamin shows the highest tumor volume, and Infubinol and Ceftamin have higher medians compared to Capomulin and Ramicane.
In the Capomulin treatment, tumor volume was highest at 48 mm on day 20 and lowest at around 40.2 mm on day 35 in a line plot.
Scatter and Regression plots show that as tumor volume decreases, mouse weight also reduces. There's a strong correlation of 0.84 between mouse weight and average tumor volume.
Different drugs were not given the same number of times, making it hard to definitively say if one drug is better than the others.
More tests are needed to decide how well these drugs work in treating tumors.

## How to Install and Run the code

To run the script:
1. Open **Jupyter Notebook** through terminal
2. Copy the git link from git repository
3. Inside the folder Data there are the CSV files.
4. Run the script using **Jupyter Notebook** to get the data results. Observation: use *Restart & Run All option* from *Kernel* in *Jupyter Notebook* or run each block of code individually to avoid any error/bugs.


## Credits

In order to complete the task, I had tutor session assistance where I could have several questions answered. I also had the opportunity to discuss the challenge with my classmate during our study sessions outside of class.
